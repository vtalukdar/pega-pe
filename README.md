# Pega Personal Edition installation in Debian 


 PLEASE NOTE : The following approach has been tested in vagrant Debian 10 OS as well a MacBook running m1 processor. The laptop runs DebianOS on the Parallels software. This has also been tested in Raspberry Pi running DietPi, a highly optimised version of the DebianOS.

BEFORE WE START : 
  
The following softwares are required: 

  ### PEGA Personal Edition 8.7 . The default downloaded ZIP folder needs to be unzipped, and kept ready.
  ### UTM. It can be downloaded here : https://mac.getutm.app/. It is completely free.
  ### Debian 11 XFCE. Download it from this link : https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/debian-11-xfce 

The PEGA server would need at least 12GB of RAM to function, and 16 GB for optimal performance. Use the Graphical install option within Debian , and complete the Debian installation within UTM. Both are available for free, and very easy to setup. Once the Virtual Machine (VM) is setup, shut it down, go to Configuration â€”> Hardware and allocate either 8GB or 12GB RAM to it. Strong recommendation here is to use 16GB RAM for this box.


PLEASE NOTE : I have given the user name as "victor", so the debian box is referred as victor@<IP Address>. Use appropriate name while installing it.

Once the vm is ready the following steps needs to be performed on the VM :


### Step 1

Once the VM is up, go to the terminal inside the VM , and get the IP address by executing the command 

    ip a

### Step 2

Now, minimize the VM, go into the Mac Terminal and SSH to the Linux VM using the command :

    ssh victor@<IP Address>

You will be prompted for password. This password will be the default password set of Parallels ID in Debian VM

### Step 3

Install GIT on the VM , by the below set of commands : 

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git

### Step 4
 
Now run the below git command to clone the required script.

    git clone https://github.com/vtalukdar/pega-pe.git

Now go inside the pega-pe folder, and execute the install script using the below set of commands : 

    cd pega-pe
    sudo su
    sh install.sh


### Step 5

Now, before any further steps are taken , go to the PEGA Personal Edition folder. Inside the data folder, there should 2 .dump folders. First , create a Terminal session within Macbook, and then copy the 2 folders into the newly created VM using the below commands : 

    cd Downloads/117149_PE_8.7/data

    scp -r *.dump victor@<IP Address>:


### Step 6

Switch to root:

    sudo su -

Move the folders into  the required folders: 

    mv /home/victor/*.dump /var/lib/postgresql 

Provide required access to the postgres user

    chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/


Switch user to postgres : 

    su - postgres

verify that you are in the required folder by doing a pwd and checking that the folder is indeed  /var/lib/postgresql 

### Step 7

    pg_restore -U postgres --disable-triggers -d postgres -O -j 2 -v sqlj.dump 
    pg_restore -U postgres --disable-triggers -d postgres -O -j 2 -v pega.dump 

Now, the below step is optional, but would provide a significant improvement in performance.

    psql
  
    reindex database postgres;


### Step 8

Test the db connectivity and verify if the server is starting up correctly :

    psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d postgres


### Step 9

Now, before any other steps are taken on the VM,  inspect the Personal Edition zip folder. It contains a JAR file known as PRPC_PE.jar. Go to the same folder as the JAR file, and execute the below steps : 


    unzip PRPC_PE.jar
    unzip PersonalEdition.zip

  (On the 2nd command , you might get a question like this : 

    replace META-INF/MANIFEST.MF? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: 

  Press Y and continue.)



### Step 10

In the same path as before, go inside tomcat/webapps folder. There are 


    scp -r *.war victor@<IP Address>:

The above command moves the file to the home folder. Now from there, move the files to the required folder, which is inside the tomcat application installed in Step 4

    sudo su -

    mv /home/victor/*.war /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.14/webapps


### Step 11

Final Step !!! 

Close all terminals just to be sure.  Then SSH from Macbook terminal to the Debian VM, as shown in Step 2

Now, navigate to the required folder , and start the tomcat as shown below : 

    sudo su -
    cd /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.14/bin
    ./startup.sh

You can optionally tail the logs by the below steps : 

    cd ../logs
    tail -f catalina.out

Once the server is up, go to this URL : 
    
    http://<IP Address>:/prweb.

The server should be up !

To shut down the server , simply execute the shutdown.sh script in the same method as given above in step 11.
